        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Rem Koolhaas is a Dutch architect, urbanist, and theorist, noted for his groundbreaking architectural designs
          and provocative writings. He founded the Office for Metropolitan Architecture (OMA) in 1975. Koolhaas' work
          often challenges conventional notions of space and function, exploring concepts such as urban density,
          globalization, and the impact of technology on architecture. Notable projects include the CCTV Headquarters in
          Beijing, the Seattle Central Library, and the Casa da Música in Porto. His influence extends beyond
          architecture, shaping discourse on urbanism and culture through his books, lectures, and exhibitions.</p>
